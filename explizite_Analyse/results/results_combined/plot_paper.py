    # You can try adjusting this value (e.g., subtracting a small number like 0.05 or 0.1)
    # or derive it from an existing plot's bottom and desired spacing.

    # Let's take the bottom of the previous row (axs_flat[2] or axs_flat[3])
    # and add some padding.
    # The `y0` of a subplot is its bottom edge. The `height` is its vertical extent.
    # The space between rows is implicitly handled by subplots.
    # If `new_bottom` is `bbox_bottom_left.y0`, it means it's exactly at the bottom of the grid row.
    # To prevent overlap with plots above, we need to push it down or increase figure's vertical spacing.

    # Let's try to infer a reasonable 'bottom' for the new axis based on the figure's bottom margin
    # and a desired vertical spacing from the row above.

    # This part is a bit tricky with mixed `subplots` and `add_axes`
    # Let's try to simply decrease the `new_bottom` to push it down.
